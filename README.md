# DCA0305-Exploring-EBay-Car-Sales

This project is based on the Guided Project proposed by the lesson "Pandas and Numpy Visualization" made by DataQuest.

It focus on applying Pandas and Numpy in data cleaning and data processing of the "Ebay Car Sales" dataset.

The code made for this project consists in readjusting columns names, converting String data into Numerical data, translating values from german to english and making an analysis of the price and mileage by brands.

## First step: Cleaning the data and constructing the algorithm

This step was made using Jupyther Notebook, due to its easy way of analysing data on the get-go.

## Second step: Converting the algorithm into a python script.

With all the code made in Jupyther Notebook done, a python script (.py) was made using only the bits of code where the data was treated. The IDE used was Spyder, but any Python IDE works for this step.

## Third step: Cleaning the code

After converting the algorithm into a script, i used the static code analysis tool PyLint to make the code cleaner and adjusting it to the standard coding practices.

To do this, the command 

> pylint script.py

was called to make sure all mistakes were corrected. According to the tool, this script has been rated 10/10.
